Ideation:
We were unsure of what to make for the project, but we had decided we wanted to make a game of some sort. I, Yifan, started suggesting some old Flash games I used to play. I ended up suggesting Sugar, Sugar. Steven and Kevin fell in love with the idea and that's how we settled on our project.

Collaboration:
We tried to split responsiblities by asking each team member what part of the project they wanted to do and allowing them to take it. The remaining bits were then split evenly. We each had our own GitHub branched where we made changes. Those changes would be pull requeted for the whole team to check before being integrated onto main.

Coding & Development:
Yifan:
I'm used to working on a coding project with many members due to my high school experience, so I didn't have much trouble. I coded all of the classes and collision. At one point, the code got rally long and hard to read, so I reformatted how we checked for levels. I made 1 really long game object that holds the specific level data for each level and we call the level through an incremented variable. This was inspiried by how the screens were implemented in the text based adventure game. I had a really hard time coding collision to work until I realized I could break all the elements down to rectangles. This helped my better visualize where the boundaries needed to be. What also helped was setting coordinates to show on screen that correlated to my mouse's position. This way I could hard code the more tricky bits of collision like the title of the start screen. One of the big challenges that came with coding collision was accounting for the sugar's vertical acceleration. If not accounted for the sugar would accelerate to a point where the game wasn't able to check for collison before it sailed past. I ended up having to add vy to every single check in the game.

Technical Highlights:
Yifan:
My 5 million if statements that check for collision I absolutely missed something, but I'm glad it works at all.
